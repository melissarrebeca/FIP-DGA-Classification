# Use of Computational Intelligence solutions to detect faults in power transformers

This repository is referring to the **FIP 30.798-2024 project**. A description of the project is explained below:

Under abnormal conditions, such as thermal or electrical stress, the insulating oil in power transformers decomposes, releasing different proportions of gases that are directly related to the type of stress suffered. The concentration of dissolved gases and the ratio between the different gases are important indices in judging the condition of power transformers. Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA), which evaluates the proportion of gases, is one of the most widely used alternatives for monitoring transformer failures. Among the DGA methods, the methods created by Michel Duval can be used with a high percentage of correct predictions compared to other classical methods, since they allow the identification of six basic fault types, as well as four subtypes of thermal faults that provide additional relevant information. Analyzing the proportion of gases produced is not a trivial process.
The overall aim of this project is to use computational intelligence solutions, such as Fuzzy Logic and Artificial Neural Networks, to detect faults in power transformers. By facilitating the identification of the transformers condition and speeding up the preventive intervention process, it is hoped to contribute to the continuous supply of energy to consumers.
